## Why Make this project
This project serves as an exploration into the fundamentals of SCSS. While I acknowledge that there is still much to learn about this styling language, my primary objective in undertaking this project was to gain hands-on experience and assess its suitability for my preferences. Working with SCSS has proven to be enjoyable, and I find its main features, including nesting, partials, variables, and lists, contribute to a more streamlined CSS development process.

As I reflect on this experience, I recognize the need for improved code modularization through better planning. Despite the learning curve, I am confident that with increased proficiency in SCSS, it will become my preferred choice for larger applications. The language's inherent capabilities for code modularization align well with my development goals, making it a promising tool for future projects.
